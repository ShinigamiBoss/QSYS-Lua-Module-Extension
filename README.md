# QSYS Lua Module Extension
 This project will enable 3rd party development for the QSYS ecosystem. Use the "QSYS Lua Extension" file in your favorite editor with the "require" function to access a complete list of the functions and parameters of the QSYS ecosystem.

 The purpose of the file is to use advanced features like intellisense and autocompletition for your QSYS lua scripting enviroment.
 For each function there is also a description of what it does and based on your enviroment the function help will show up.
